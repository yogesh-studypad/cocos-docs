Cocos2d-JS is Cocos2d-x engine's JavaScript version that includes Cocos2d-html5 and Cocos2d-x JavaScript Bindings. It equips your game with cross-browser and cross-platform abilities, accompanied by full Cocos2d-x features and simplified JavaScript friendly APIs.

Cocos2d-JS reinvented workflows for all platforms in v3.0, it provides a consistent development experience for whichever platform you want to distribute to, no matter web and native. "Code once, run everywhere" is incredibly easy and natural in Cocos2d-JS. With one single JavaScript code base, you can run your game on all web browsers and native platforms including Mac OS, Windows, iOS and Android. This will bring your game great opportunities in almost all channels of distribution. On the other hand, if you are only interested in casual games on the web, you can embed directly in your web page the Cocos2d-JS Lite Version which is extremely easy to use and light as a feather.

Furthermore, JavaScript friendly APIs make your game development experience a breeze - easy to code, test and distribute. In the meantime, Cocos2d-JS v3.0 is super powerful along with all these cool new features: Editors Support, Assets Manager, Object Pool, JS to Objective-C/JAVA reflection, etc.

## Workflows

- Cross platforms developers can use Cocos Console to create projects, boost their development with web version engine and deploy games onto all native platforms and all browsers with Cocos Console.

- Casual web game developers can download the Lite Version and start to develop just like using other web frameworks (e.g. jQuery).
